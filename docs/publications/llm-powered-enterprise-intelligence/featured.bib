  abstract = {<jats:p>Abstract—In this paper, we introduce the Enterprise Intelligence Pipeline, an automated system designed to extract, verify, and match primary business data using a combination of AI-powered tools and structured rule-based logic. The pipeline leverages natural language processing and a Company Identity Matcher module to enrich minimal input queries with accurate and reliable information. Its modular architecture, orchestrated via Amazon ECS, ensures scalability, traceability, and high data quality across enterprise workflows. The system significantly reduces manual effort, improves data consistency, and integrates seamlessly into broader decision-making platforms. Additionally, it supports real-time data validation and feedback mechanisms, enabling continuous enhancement of data accuracy. With a plug-and-play framework, the pipeline is easily customizable for industry-specific applications. By integrating deterministic rules with probabilistic AI models, it offers a balanced solution that combines precision with adaptability.
