abstract: "Color vision deficiency (CVD) affects a high percentage of the population worldwide. When seeing a volume visualization result, persons with CVD may be incapable of discriminating the classification information expressed in the image if the color transfer function or the color blending used in the direct volume rendering is not appropriate. Conventional methods used to address this problem adopt advanced image recoloring techniques to enhance the rendering results frame-by-frame; unfortunately, problematic perceptual results may still be generated. This paper proposes an alternative solution that complements the image recoloring scheme by reconfiguring the components of the direct volume rendering (DVR) pipeline. Our approach optimizes the mapped colors of a transfer function to simulate CVD-friendly effect that is generated by applying the image recoloring to the results with the initial transfer function. The optimization process has a low computational complexity, and only needs to be performed once for a given transfer function. To achieve detail-preserving and perceptually natural semi-transparent effects, we introduce a new color composition mode that works in the color space of dichromats. Experimental results and a pilot study demonstrates that our approach can yield dichromats-friendly and consistent volume visualization in real-time."
