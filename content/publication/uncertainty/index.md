abstract: "This paper presents an efficient visualization and exploration approach for modeling and characterizing the relationships and uncertainties in the context of a multidimensional ensemble dataset. Its core is a novel dissimilarity-preserving projection technique that characterizes not only the relationships among the mean values of the ensemble data objects but also the relationships among the distributions of ensemble members. This uncertainty-aware projection scheme leads to an improved understanding of the intrinsic structure in an ensemble dataset. The analysis of the ensemble dataset is further augmented by a suite of visual encoding and exploration tools. Experimental results on both artificial and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."
