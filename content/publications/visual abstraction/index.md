abstract: "Scatterplots are widely used to visualize scatter dataset for exploring outliers, clusters, local trends, and correlations. Depicting multi-class scattered points within a single scatterplot view, however, may suffer from heavy overdraw, making it inefficient for data analysis. This paper presents a new visual abstraction scheme that employs a hierarchical multi-class sampling technique to show a feature-preserving simplification. To enhance the density contrast, the colors of multiple classes are optimized by taking the multi-class point distributions into account. We design a visual exploration system that supports visual inspection and quantitative analysis from different perspectives. We have applied our system to several challenging datasets, and the results demonstrate the efficiency of our approach."
